# SentinalsProxy

A high-performance, security-focused Minecraft proxy engineered for unparalleled server compatibility, scalability, and flexibility. SentinalsProxy aims to provide a robust and modern platform for server networks of all sizes.

SentinalsProxy is licensed under the GPLv3 license.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Modern & Maintainable Codebase:** Built with best practices, making it easy for developers to understand, extend, and contribute.
* **High Performance:** Optimized to handle thousands of concurrent players on a single proxy instance.
* **Powerful API:** A flexible, ground-up API designed to avoid the pitfalls of older proxy systems and empower developers.
* **Broad Server Support:** First-class support for Paper, Sponge, Fabric, and Forge. While other server implementations may work, we prioritize compatibility with these platforms.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Java 17 or newer is required.

### Building from Source

SentinalsProxy uses Gradle to manage dependencies and build the project. We recommend using the included Gradle wrapper (`gradlew`) to ensure consistency.

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SentinalsProxy.git
   cd SentinalsProxy
   ```

2. **Build the project:**
   * On Windows:

     ```powershell
     .\gradlew build
     ```

   * On Linux/macOS:

     ```bash
     ./gradlew build
     ```

3. The final JAR file will be located in the `proxy/build/libs/` directory.

### Running the Proxy

Once you have built the project, copy the JAR ending with `-all.jar` from the `proxy/build/libs/` directory to a new folder.

Run the proxy using the following command:

```bash
java -jar sentinalsproxy-proxy-VERSION-all.jar
```

On the first run, SentinalsProxy will generate a `sentinals.toml` configuration file, which you can edit to configure your server network.
